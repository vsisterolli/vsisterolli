Hi! I'm Victor, a FullStack Software Engineer.

I started programming when i was 12, with the goal of producing games (like 90% of teenagers who start programing ðŸ˜Š).
Ended up discovering competitive programming and it fitted perfectly to me, who always loved challenging myself and my logic to solve all kinds of problems.

I'm now using all the logic that I've developed trying to solve real world problems, using programming as my main weapon.

I might use all these technologies to help with that:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, React, Node, AWS, Docker.

Also, not neglect Soft Skills, such as agile methodologies.

Are you interested in contact me?
