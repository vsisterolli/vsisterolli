Hi! I'm Victor, a FullStack Software Engineer.

I started programming when I was 12, to produce games (like 90% of teenagers who start programming ðŸ˜Š).
Ended up discovering competitive programming and it fitted perfectly for me, who always loved challenging myself and my logic to solve all kinds of problems.

I'm now using all the logic I've developed to solve real-world problems, using programming as my main weapon.

I might use all these technologies to help with that:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, React, Node, AWS, Docker.

I also provide Soft Skills (including Agile Methodologies) while working.

Are you interested in contacting me?
