         <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I really like math and coding, currently studying a lot to become a Machine Learning specialist.

Since High School, I participated in a lot of math, algorithms and data structures competition, like the ACM-ICPC and IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)-like competitions. So, becoming a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning engineer is just the natural path, thinking, solving problems, extracting useful insights in a world of data is really what I like doing!

About my working tools, I usually work with these technologies:

Don't see any technology that you think it's crucial? Don't worry! I learn it pretty fast, I'm confident on my autodidactism, problem solving capacity and solid foundations.

To know more about me, here are some books and courses I studied through 2025 (Updated on January):
- Calculus Stewart, James (Vol 1)
- Python DataScience Handbook, Jake VanderPlas
- Mathematics Specialization for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra, Imperial London College
- Mathematics Specialization for Machine Learning: Multivariate Calculus, Imperial London College (WIP)
- Statistics 110: Probability, Harvard (WIP)

I also have about 2 years of experience as a Fullstack Software Engineer, even not being the area' I'm focused nowadays, these building skills can show useful many times, and gave me real experience using Python.

If there is any working opportunitys as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer, it will be a pleasure to answer you in one of my social medias:
