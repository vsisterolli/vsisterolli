Hi! I'm Victor, a programmer!

I started programming when I was 12, to produce games (like 90% of teenagers who start programming ðŸ˜Š).
Ended up discovering competitive programming and it fitted perfectly for me, who always loved challenging myself and my logic to solve all kinds of problems.

As a competitive programmer, I became a tri-medallist reaching the top 6 of my country in the national high school competition in algorithms, data structures and programming logic.

I'm now using all the logic I've developed to solve real-world problems, acting as a web developer.

That is my current stack for now:

Web development fundamentals: HTML & CSS
Programming languages: JavaScript/TypeScript (Node) | Python | SQL | C++
Front-end libraries: React.js
Databases: Postgres (Relational database) | MongoDB (Non-relational database)
ORMs: Prisma
Cloud Technologies: AWS and Docker
Testing tools: Jest, Cypress and Selenium.

Don't see any technology that you think it's crucial? Don't worry! I assure you I can learn it faster than you can blink ðŸ˜Š.

With this stack I was able to produce more than 10 complete projects acting as a full stack web developer. If you need a responsive layout or a RESTful API, than you can count on me!

I also have experience with Soft Skills and Agile Methodologies such as Kanban .

Are you interested in contacting me?
